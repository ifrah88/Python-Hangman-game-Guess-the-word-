# Python-Hangman-game-Guess-the-word-
1. **Importing Modules:**
   - The code begins by importing necessary modules: `hangmanimages` (presumably contains ASCII art for hangman visualization), `random`, and `time`.

2. **`chooseWord()` Function:**
   - This function reads a file named "hangmanwords.txt" and selects a random word from the list of words provided in the file. The chosen word is stored in the global variable `word`.

3. **`main()` Function:**
   - This function initializes global variables used in the game, such as `count` (guessing attempts), `display` (current state of the word being guessed), `word` (the target word), `already_guessed` (list of letters already guessed by the user), `length` (length of the target word), `play_game` (variable to control replaying), and `limit` (maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed).

4. **`func()` Function:**
   - This function prints a score message based on the chosen difficulty level (`user_setting`).

5. **`play_loop()` Function:**
   - This function prompts the user if they want to play again after finishing a game. It ensures that the user inputs either 'y' or 'n', and based on their choice, either re-initializes the game or ends it.

6. **`guessed_display_tup` and `guessed_display` Set:**
   - These variables are defined but not used in the provided code.

7. **`hangman()` Function:**
   - This is the main function for playing the Hangman game.
   - It prompts the user to make a guess and handles the logic of processing the guess.
   - It also updates the hangman visualization based on incorrect guesses and checks for win or loss conditions.

8. **Game Initialization and User Input:**
   - The code begins by asking the user if they'd like to play the game. If they choose to play, they're prompted to enter their name and choose a difficulty level (number of lives).
   - Based on the chosen difficulty level, the game initializes with a set number of lives.

9. **Running the Game:**
   - The game is started by calling `main()` and `hangman()`, which initiates the gameplay.

10. **End of Game:**
    - If the user wins or loses, they are given an appropriate message along with their score (based on the chosen difficulty level).

11. **Exiting the Game:**
    - If the user chooses not to play or exits the game after playing, a farewell message is displayed.
