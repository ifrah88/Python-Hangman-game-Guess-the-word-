# Python-Hangman-game-Guess-the-word-
This Python script is a console-based Hangman game. It uses concepts like dictionaries, tuples, sets, lists, and exception handling. The game prompts the user to play, asks for their name, and lets them choose a difficulty level. The user guesses letters to complete a hidden word. The game provides feedback on their performance. It displays hangman visuals for incorrect guesses and allows multiple rounds. The code includes ASCII art for hangman visuals and reads words from a file named "hangmanwords.txt". The user can play with different difficulty levels, and the game encourages replaying.
